            Hi! That’s an article about the Sinai peninsula. Trust me, it will
            be very interesting, LET”S GO! Sinai is the part of Egypt, which
            connects Africa and Asia. It lies between two gulfs of the Red Sea -
            Suez in the east and the Gulf of Aqaba in the west. From the north
            it is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea. The peninsula does not have
            exact boundaries, so different sources estimate its area
            differently.

            <p>
              When looking on the map, Red Sea is actually “hugging” the south
              part of Sinai Peninsula. It’s no wonder that the Red Sea is
              a major   hot spot for scuba diving and snorkeling when you
              consider the rich variety of its underwater ecosystem. It is home
              to more than 1,200 species of fish, including 44 species of
              sharks. Nearly 20% of these are found only in the Red Sea. Divers
              can swim with brightly colored angelfish, butterflyfish and
              clownfish.

              The Mount Sinai is well-known as holy place, where God has given
              Moses Ten Commandments. Now lots of people come here and climb to
              the peak. (P.s it’s not like an usual mountain hike. Climbing up
              to the summit usually takes 4-5 hours.) Visitors usually come
              early in the morning to see an amazing sunrise.

              Well, desert biking pretends not to be a sight, but it is really
              cool activity when you dislike lying on the beach during whole
              vacation time. It is a 90% possibility that you will ride early in
              the morning, so don’t forget about setting a waking alarm!

            Sinai’s allure is legendary. Its spectacular landscapes, thriving
            flora and fauna, and unique history, the store of centuries, have
            long held sway in the imagination of millions. The high mountains
            and wadis of the peninsula’s south provide the fertile soil that
            feeds some of Egypt’s highest diversity of plants, while foxes,
            vipers, lizards, and tortoises are just some of the animals that
            make their home in the north, which is characterized by lagoons and
            vast dunes of soft sand.
